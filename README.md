# DKClone Devlog Readme
2024.9.23 - Start on Gantt Chart to outline project details and create project roadmap.  Initiated GitHub to document Devlog, as well as version control.
This is my first entry into my Devlog with the assumption that it is essentially a note taking tool to review progress made during the creation of my game. Although I have no experience in game dev, no coding, no graphics, no sound, etc. the goal is to essentially recreate Diddy Kong Racing (without any copyright or patent issues).  Wish me luck!
