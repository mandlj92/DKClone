# DKClone Devlog Readme
2024.9.23

Start on Gantt Chart to outline project details and create project roadmap.  Initiated GitHub to document Devlog, as well as version control.
This is my first entry into my Devlog with the assumption that it is essentially a note taking tool to review progress made during the creation of my game. Although I have no experience in game dev, no coding, no graphics, no sound, etc. the goal is to essentially recreate Diddy Kong Racing (without any copyright or patent issues).  Wish me luck!

Continued working on the Gantt Chart and make sure that it was fully fleshed out.  Some of the low hanging fruit, like setting up the project in Godot and setting up and working on this DevLog are completed.  I now have to setup the project scope, and begin the implementation of version control (after I figure out what that means).  Some of these tasks seem almost to easy, and my estimation of the time it will take to complete things seems skewed by my lack of experience.  Hopefully I can keep on task, and more importantly, actually follow through on the completion of things.

Worked on a vehicle state machine today, trying to implement various vehicle types such as kart, hovercraft, and airplane.  Having some difficulty with collission layers and ensuring that the "vehicles" don't float through the collission plane that I setup.  Realized that a state machine might be too complicated for me, as well as unneccesary given the lack of complexity in my game.
